##  <u>Problem Statement</u>

​				The user can enter the food items consumed [item(s) and quantity] and identify actual calorie intake to match that with recommended calories. The solution can help the user to identify his weight goals : Lose/ Maintain/ Gain and how much to lose/ gain. Nowadays everyone is concerned about their Health and Fitness, but none of them are not willing to take any action for it. We have come up with a simple solution, we as a team will be developing an application which helps the users to track their fitness goals and their diet.

## <u>Idea Behind the App</u>

- Most of us don’t realize how many calories is actually present in the food that we consume.
- Most of us don’t realize how many calories is actually present in the food that we consume.
- For humans, healthy fats are essential, and also since healthy and clean food can be high in calories and these can add up easily, so they should be tracked.
- The main motive behind this app is to meet people health goals and stay on track.

## <u>Architecture of the App</u>

- The user would be able to create an account and create a profile, where all the analytics will be stored for later references.
- Once the user has created an account he/she is redirected to a menu where the user can decide among the following:
  1. Chatbot
  2. Calorie Tracker
  3. Meal Planner 
  4. BMI Calculator

- The chatbot is an interactive bot named **'Eve'**, she will guide you through all type of FAQ's asked by the user and doubts regarding the meal plan. 
- The **Calorie Tracker** keeps a track on the calorie of the user from breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. The user can input the food he would like to have and the slider will automatically slide it to the right amount of calories.
- The **Meal Planner** which suggests the possible meals to consume based on the target calorie intake provided by the end-user. So basically it lets you enter the amount of calories you wish to consume for the whole day and the app compiles a meal plan (breakfast, lunch, dinner) along with the recipes.
- The **BMI Calculator** keeps a regular check on your BMI index when you enter in your height and weight.

## <u>How is our solution different?</u>

- As a whole the entire app is personalized and user-friendly with a lot of features.

- We have implemented a really simple diet and meal plans for the user and reminders, so he/she can follow up with the plan easily. 
- Chatbots are a really helpful feature in most apps, so we will be also be trying to implement that also along with the entire app.
- People these days snap pictures of foods and put it up in social media, so we have implemented a Visual Calorie Counter which is an image recognition deep learning model which provides calories and various other information for the user before sharing it in a social media platform

## <u>Future possible enhancements</u>

- We are also planning to develop this app to a community where individual users can interact with each other and also with proper instructors for an enhanced diet plan.
- The app can also can be made a premium version where the app unlocks the features such as the chatbot and the Visual Calorie Counter.
- The app can also implemented with a health tracker so the app is more productive in a lot of ways.
- The chatbot will be improved in a more functional and interactive one.
